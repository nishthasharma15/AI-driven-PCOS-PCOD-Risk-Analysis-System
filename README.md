# AI-Driven PCOS/PCOD Risk Analysis System

## Overview

Polycystic Ovary Syndrome (PCOS) and Polycystic Ovarian Disease (PCOD) are common hormonal disorders affecting women of reproductive age. These conditions often remain undiagnosed due to overlapping symptoms, lack of early screening tools, and delayed medical consultation.

This project provides an **AI-driven risk prediction system** that uses machine learning models to analyze clinical and lifestyle parameters and predict the likelihood of PCOS/PCOD.

The goal is to assist in **early awareness and preliminary risk assessment** using data-driven methods.

## Problem Statement

Early diagnosis of PCOS/PCOD is challenging because:

- Symptoms vary widely between individuals  
- Multiple medical and lifestyle factors must be analyzed together  
- Many women do not have access to early screening support  

Therefore, the problem addressed is:

> To build a machine learning-based risk analysis system that predicts the possibility of PCOS/PCOD using patient health data.
